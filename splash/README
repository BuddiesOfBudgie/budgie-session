This directory contains two small programs used at startup or
shutdown to do some user-notificationy things that used to be handled
directly by gnome-session.

  * gnome-login-sound: This plays the login sound. If invoked with the
    "--logout" flag, it plays the logout sound instead.

  * gnome-logout-sound.sh: This gets installed into the session
    "shutdown" directory to run at logout time. It just invokes
    gnome-login-sound with the --logout flag.
