These are wrappers and helpers to start things that are currently
(GNOME 2.18) started specially by gnome-session, which don't need
special hardcoding in the shiny new future, but where some additional
functionality needs to be added to the programs to take advantage of
the new gnome-session features and make everything work.

  * gnome-settings-daemon-helper: This does two things that have
    traditionally been done by gnome-session, but which ought to be
    done by gnome-settings-daemon: setting the screen resolution, and
    setting the GTK_RC_FILES environment variable.

    For setting the screen resolution, see
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=434982

    For GTK_RC_FILES, gnome-settings-daemon (specifically
    gnome-settings-gtk1theme.c) should set this itself using the D-Bus
    Setenv interface.
