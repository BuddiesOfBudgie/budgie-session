gnome-session \- Starts up the GNOME desktop environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnome-session [\-\-choosesession] [\-\-failsafe]
[\-\-purge-delay=DELAY] [\-\-warn-delay=DELAY] [\-\-suicide-delay=DELAY]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIgnome-session\fP program starts up the GNOME desktop
environment.  This command is typically executed by your login manager
(either gdm, xdm, or from your X startup scripts).  It will load
either your last session, or it will provide a default session for the
user as defined by the system administrator (or the default GNOME
installation on your system).
.PP
\fIgnome-session\fP is an X11R6 session manager.  It can manage GNOME
applications as well as any X11R6 SM compliant.
.PP
\fIgnome-session\fP uses the contents of the  ~/.gnome/session file
for starting up.  Various default values are provided in case the file
does not exist.
.PP
.SH The ~/.gnome/session configuration file
Multiple sessions can be stored in the file, in the special section
__GSM__ the key "Default Session" will point to the sesion to be
loaded (this typically points to "Default").
.PP
If the session file does not exist, \fIgnome-session\fP will use the
contents of the 
.I @datadir@/gnome/default.session
file.

The following options are supported:
.TP
.I "--choose-session"

default.session file.
.TP
.I "--purge-delay"

.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fIgnome-session\fP sets a number of environment variables before it
launches the session:

This variable is used by session-manager aware clients to contact
gnome-session.

\fIgnome-session\fP (as it might be different from the environment
