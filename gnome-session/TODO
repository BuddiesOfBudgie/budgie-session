Gnome Session Manager

This is still a work in progress.  Here's my plan of attack:

* Write a program to contact the sm and request a save/exit

* Write code that understands shutdown commands and resign commands

* Add a default profile so that something will happen if one doesn't
  exist.  The default profile is described below.

* Add remote-start capabilities, like XSM.  However, support krsh and
  ssh as well.

* Implement RestartImmediately hint.

* Write a user interface of some sort.
  Initially this will be very minimal.
  I'm tentatively planning to do the UI in Guile, so that different
  personalities can easily be tacked on.

* Write code to use timeouts in useful places.
  A session save shouldn't hang because of one losing client.

* Export a CORBA interface exposing all interesting functionality
  (See Elliot's IDL code in components/)

* Update exec.c to report errors in some meaningful way
  A dialog is simplest, but a post to the event manager is perhaps best.

* Change session management code into library that can be used
  by embedder apps.  This probably requires merging with
  gnome-session, since the resulting program will have to be both a
  client and a server, and the two parts must collude.


I don't have a schedule for this work.  Feel free to hack on it if you
feel like it.  Please contact me if you do so.

================================================================

Some known bugs:

- None??

================================================================

The default profile:

We'll provide a default profile so that first time users will see
something sensible.  The current thinking for the default profile:

* Whatever magic Gnome programs are required (i.e., CORBA daemons)
* A window manager (not sure which one yet; it depends on what is
  available, easy-to-use, and Gnome-compliant)
* The panel
* The file manager opened to `~'
* The help browser opened to an "About Gnome" page

================================================================

Some random stuff:

- handle initialization commands

- make rsh stuff configurable somehow
  in particular support ssh

- doesn't support current directory on restart yet.
  (or is this even required??)

- If program crashes during save yourself, gsm doesn't notice
  and will hang
