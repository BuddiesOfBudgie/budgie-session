Gnome Session Manager

This is still a work in progress.  Here's my plan of attack:

* Test code that restores and deletes sessions
  [ the gnome config functions need a going over before this will work ]
  [ test restores by hacking the config file by hand ]

* Write exec.c and do the first real test

* Write code that understands restart hints, etc.

* Write a user interface of some sort.
  Initially this will be very minimal.
  I'm tentatively planning to do the UI in Guile, so that different
  personalities can easily be tacked on.

* Write code to use timeouts in useful places.
  A session save shouldn't hang because of one losing client.

* Export a CORBA interface exposing all interesting functionality

* Change session management code into library that can be used
  by embedder apps.  This probably requires merging with
  gnome-session, since the resulting program will have to be both a
  client and a server, and the two parts must collude.


I don't have a schedule for this work.  Feel free to hack on it if you
feel like it.  Please contact me if you do so.

================================================================

Some known bugs:

- None??  (Well, saving doesn't work, but that is gnome-config's fault)

================================================================

Some random stuff:

- handle initialization commands

- make rsh stuff configurable somehow
  in particular support ssh

- doesn't support current directory on restart yet.
  (or is this even required??)

- make sure \0 handled correctly (I forget if it should be
  included in counts or not).  check gnome-session.c too.

- If program crashes during save yourself, gsm doesn't notice
  and will hang

- should be named `gnome'
