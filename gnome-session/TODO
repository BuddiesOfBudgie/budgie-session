Gnome Session Manager

This is still a work in progress.  Here's my plan of attack:

* Write stub main() that can be used to debug communications code
  in manager.c

* Write code that saves, restores, and removes sessions
  I plan to do this by first writing some code that understands how to
  interpret SmProp structures; then write code on top of that to extract
  the useful properties.

* Write a user interface of some sort.
  Initially this will be very minimal.
  I'm tentatively planning to do the UI in Guile, so that different
  personalities can easily be tacked on.

* Export a CORBA interface exposing all interesting functionality


I don't have a schedule for this work.  Feel free to hack on it if you
feel like it.  Also feel free to contact me about it.

  in particular support ssh
