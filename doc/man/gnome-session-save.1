.SH NAME
gnome-session-save \- Saves or ends the current GNOME session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnome-session-save [\-\-logout] [\-\-force\-logout] [\-\-logout\-dialog] [\-\-shutdown\-dialog] [\-\-gui] [\-\-kill [\-\-silent]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIgnome-session-save\fP can be used from a GNOME session to save a snapshot
of the currently running applications.  This session will be later
restored at your next GNOME session.
.PP
The \fB\-\-gui\fP option will report errors in dialog boxes instead of
printing to stderr.

If called with the \fB\-\-logout\fP option, the current GNOME session will be
ended, unless logging out has been inhibited by an application.  The
\fB\-\-force\-logout\fP option can be used to end the session regardless of
the inhibition state.

When the \fB\-\-logout\-dialog\fP option is given, the standard dialog
displaying logout options is displayed.  When \fB\-\-shutdown\-dialog\fP
option is given, the standard dialog displaying shutdown options is
displayed.

The \fB\-\-kill\fP and \fB\-\-silent\fP options are deprecated.  The
\fB\-\-kill\fP option is equivalent to the \fB\-\-logout\-dialog\fP
option.  If \fB\-\-silent\fP is used with \fB\-\-kill\fR, then it will
behave as if \fB\-\-logout\fP was used.

The session is not saved when \fIgnome-session-save\fP is called with any of
the options ending the session.
